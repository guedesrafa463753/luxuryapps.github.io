    <section class="card">
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>Tap The Circle</strong> mobile application (“App”)
        handles information when you use it. By using the App, you agree to this Policy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <h2>1) Who we are (Controller)</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided by <strong>Luxury Apps</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”).<br />
      <strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:suporte@luxuryapps.com.br">suporte@luxuryapps.com.br</a>
    </p>

    <h2>2) Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The App <strong>does not require an account</strong> and <strong>does not collect personal data directly</strong> to function.</li>
      <li>The App is a simple reflex game and <strong>does not request access</strong> to your contacts, photos, camera, microphone, or precise location.</li>
      <li>The App may open external links (for example, <strong>Terms of Use</strong> and this <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>) in your browser.</li>
      <li>If you email us for support, we will process the information you provide (see Section 6).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Information the App collects directly</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not directly collect your name, email, phone number, address, precise location, contacts, photos,
      or any content from your device in order to provide gameplay.
    </p>

    <h2>4) Information stored on your device (local storage)</h2>
    <p>
      To provide basic functionality, the App stores some information <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
      For example, the App may store your <strong>best score</strong> per difficulty level (Easy/Normal/Hard)
      using iOS local storage (for example, <code>UserDefaults</code>). This information stays on your device
      and is not sent to us by the App.
    </p>

    <h2>5) Advertising and analytics</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Current status:</strong> This version of the App does <strong>not</strong> include advertising SDKs
      or analytics SDKs by default.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      If you add third-party services in a future update (for example, Google AdMob for ads or crash/analytics tools),
      this Policy should be updated to describe what those providers collect and how they use it.
    </p>

    <h2>6) Support email</h2>
    <p>If you contact us by email, we may process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>your email address;</li>
      <li>the content of your message and any attachments you send;</li>
      <li>basic metadata needed to respond (for example, timestamps).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We use this information <strong>only</strong> to provide support, respond to requests, and maintain communication with you.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Sharing of information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell personal data. We may share information only in limited cases, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers</strong> (only if you use them, e.g., email infrastructure) to operate support communications;</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requirements</strong> if we believe disclosure is required by law, regulation, court order, or valid government request;</li>
      <li><strong>Safety and security</strong> to protect rights, users, and prevent fraud or abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) Data retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The App does not maintain user accounts.</li>
      <li>Local game data (like best scores) remains on your device unless you delete the App or reset the data.</li>
      <li>Support emails may be retained as long as needed to address your request and/or comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9) International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      If you contact us by email, your message may be processed and stored on email servers that may be located
      in countries other than your own, depending on your email provider and ours.
    </p>

    <h2>10) Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable measures to protect information we process (such as support emails). However, no method of
      transmission or storage is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>11) Your choices and rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have rights to request access, correction, or deletion
      of personal information we process (primarily support communications). To make a request, contact:
      <a href="mailto:suporte@luxuryapps.com.br">suporte@luxuryapps.com.br</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Note: data stored locally on your device (like best scores) can generally be removed by uninstalling the App.
    </p>

    <h2>12) Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under 13 and is not designed to knowingly collect personal information from children.
      If you believe a child has provided personal information to us via support email, please contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>13) Third-party links</h2>
    <p>
      The App may include links to third-party websites (for example, Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy).
      When you follow a link, the third party’s policies apply.
    </p>

    <h2>14) Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date when changes are made.
